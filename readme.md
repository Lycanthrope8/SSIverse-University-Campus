# SSIverse University Campus - Setup Documentation

## Project Overview

**"Enabling SSI in Metaverses"** is a research project that demonstrates Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) functionality within immersive 3D metaverse environments. The SSIverse University Campus prototype combines blockchain-based identity management with virtual reality experiences, allowing users to interact with digital credentials in a spatial computing environment.

## Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

* **Backend Infrastructure** : acapy-cloud running SSI agents and trust registry services
* **Frontend Experience** : Wonderland Engine 3D metaverse with wallet integration

## Setup Options

Choose one of the two setup options below based on your hardware availability and preferences:

### üñ•Ô∏è Option 1: Dual Machine Setup (Recommended)

 **Best for** : Production environments, better performance, resource isolation

* **Ubuntu Machine** : Runs the SSI backend infrastructure (acapy-cloud)
* **Windows Machine** : Runs the 3D metaverse frontend and wallet service
* **Connection** : Machines communicate via ngrok-exposed URLs

**Advantages:**

* Better performance and resource allocation
* Clear separation of concerns
* Easier debugging and development
* Production-ready architecture

‚û°Ô∏è **[Follow Dual Machine Setup Guide](https://claude.ai/chat/DUAL_MACHINE_SETUP.md)**

---

### üíª Option 2: Single Windows Machine (WSL)

 **Best for** : Limited hardware, learning purposes

* **WSL Ubuntu** : Runs the SSI backend infrastructure
* **Native Windows** : Runs the 3D metaverse frontend and wallet service
* **Connection** : Components communicate either localhost or ngrok (Preferred)

**Advantages:**

* Single machine requirement
* Simplified networking
* Lower hardware requirements
* Good for development and testing

‚û°Ô∏è **[Follow Single Machine WSL Setup Guide](https://claude.ai/chat/WSL_SINGLE_MACHINE_SETUP.md)**

## Quick Start Decision Tree

```
Do you have access to both Ubuntu and Windows machines?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Use Dual Machine Setup (Option 1)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Do you have a Windows machine with WSL capability?
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Use Single Machine WSL Setup (Option 2)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí You'll need to set up WSL on Windows or access an Ubuntu machine
```

## System Requirements

### Dual Machine Setup

* **Ubuntu Machine** : 8GB RAM, 50GB storage, Docker support
* **Windows Machine** : 8GB RAM, 20GB storage, Node.js support

### Single Machine WSL Setup

* **Windows Machine** : 16GB RAM (recommended), 70GB storage, WSL 2 support
* **Windows 10 version 2004+ or Windows 11**

## Repository Structure

* **Backend Repository** : [acapy-cloud](https://github.com/Lycanthrope8/acapy-cloud.git)
* **Frontend Repository** : [SSIverse-University-Campus](https://github.com/Lycanthrope8/SSIverse-University-Campus.git)

## Common Prerequisites (Both Options)

* **Git** - Version control system
* **SSH Keys** - Configured for GitHub access
* **ngrok account** - For exposing local services
* **Node.js and npm** - For wallet service (Windows side)
* **Wonderland Engine** - For 3D metaverse environment

## Getting Help

### Documentation Resources

* [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/Lycanthrope8/acapy-cloud/blob/master/docs/src/Quick%20Start%20Guide.md) - acapy-cloud setup details
* [Example Flows](https://github.com/Lycanthrope8/acapy-cloud/blob/master/docs/src/Example%20Flows.md) - Understanding system workflows

### Video Tutorials

* [SSH Key Setup](https://youtu.be/Zzqtj0sRB1k) - Works for Ubuntu, Windows, and WSL

### Troubleshooting

Both setup guides include comprehensive troubleshooting sections covering:

* SSH key configuration issues
* Docker and containerization problems
* Network connectivity challenges
* Environment configuration errors
* Performance optimization tips

## Project Goals

This research project demonstrates:

* **SSI Integration** : Seamless credential management in virtual environments
* **Spatial Computing** : 3D interfaces for digital identity interactions
* **Interoperability** : Cross-platform identity verification systems
* **User Experience** : Intuitive credential workflows in metaverse contexts
